Documents are represented with a grid of HOG descriptors, and a sliding window approach is used to locate the document regions that are most similar to the query. We use the exemplar SVM framework to produce a better representation of the query in an unsupervised way. Finally, the document descriptors are precomputed and compressed with Product Quantization. This offers two advantages: first, a large number of documents can be kept in RAM memory at the same time. Second, the sliding window becomes significantly faster since distances between quantized HOG descriptors can be precomputed.  Our results significantly outperform other segmentation-free methods in the literature, both in accuracy and in speed and memory usage.\r\n\r\n### People\r\n\r\n* Jon Almazán\r\n* Albert Gordo\r\n* Alicia Fornés\r\n* Ernest Valveny\r\n\r\n### BMVC 2012 Paper Citation\r\nJon Almazán, Albert Gordo, Alicia Fornés, Ernest Valveny. **Efficient Exemplar Word Spotting**.
